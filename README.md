============
These exercises were utilized in 2013: A H4CK Odyssey, an event sponsored by Facebook. 
This event was hosted by the NULLify Computer Security Group from the University of
Nebraska at Omaha. The competition was 10 hours and specifically designed for local
area high schools.

These exercises will be retired after this readme has been completed.
